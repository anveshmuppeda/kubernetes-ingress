## Features  
* Displays the Pod Name and Node Name dynamically based on the environment.  
* Uses a lightweight base image (nginx:alpine) for fast startup and reduced resource usage.  
* Includes default values for pod and node names if not provided, ensuring robust behavior.  
* Simple HTML/CSS layout for easy customization and readability.  

# 
## Usage  
### 1. Pull the Image:  
```sh
docker pull anvesh35/echopod:latest
```  
### 2. Run the Container:  
```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 -e NODE_NAME="your-node-name" anvesh35/echo-pod-name:latest
```
### 3. Access the Application:  
Open your web browser and navigate to http://<public-ip>:80 to see the pod information displayed.  

## Environment Variables  
**NODE_NAME:** Specify the name of the node where the pod is running. If not provided, the default value will be "Unknown Node".  
**POD_NAME:** The Pod Name is automatically determined by the hostname of the container.
